1. What is the definition of server port?

A server port in cybersecurity is a numerical endpoint facilitating communication, enabling distinct processes or services to manage data traffic securely over a network.

2. What is server port range?

A server port range refers to a specified range of port numbers that can be used for communication between computers, allowing multiple services or processes on a server to operate within a designated and predefined set of port values.

3. How many bits does number above represent?

The number of bits required to represent a port range depends on the size of the range. If we consider a standard port range, such as 1 to 65535 (the maximum value for a 16-bit unsigned integer), it would require at least 16 bits to represent each individual port number in the range.
