The storexss.php script insecurely outputs data from storedxss.txt directly to the browser without sanitizing it. This flaw allows execution of malicious scripts stored in the text file, enabling attackers to redirect users, steal cookies, or perform unauthorized actions. To mitigate such risks, all user-generated content should be encoded or sanitized before rendering to prevent the execution of harmful code.
